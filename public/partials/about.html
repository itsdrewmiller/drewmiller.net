	<p><strong>Drew Miller</strong>.  Some might call him a leader.  Others would call him a <em>hero</em>.  As Vice President of Engineering at <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com">NGP VAN</a>, he dedicates 8, sometimes even 9 hours a day to progressive causes, helping Democrats, labor unions, and non-profits keep tabs on their data and run successful campaigns.  All he asks in return is a competitive salary in a high cost-of-living area, a really fast computer, unlimited snacks, pop, and beer, free health care, and a paid vacation somewhere sunny every couple of years.  Did he mention that NGP VAN <a href="http://ngpvan.com/jobs">is hiring</a>?

	<p>Drew has been with NGP VAN (or one of its predecessors) since January of 2009, starting out as an entry level developer.  He worked for the Obama campaign in 2008 and the Iowa Democratic Party in 2007 and 2008 working in both the data and IT departments.  Notably, he built the software that powered Iowa's caucus reporting system - the only early primary technology for <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/01/04/430223/-Republican-in-competence-in-action">either party</a> in any state not to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/01/08/430484/-Results-Thread-4">crash</a>.

	<p>Prior to getting into campaign technology full time, Drew worked for the Iowa Democratic Party doing what is called <em>field</em>.  This refers to direct voter contact, or "people who won't stop calling you during election season".  In 2006 he was regional field director for the Ames-Fort Dodge-Marshalltown area (go Region 8!), after serving as a lowly canvasser in 2004.  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minivan-touch/id352087547?mt=8">MiniVAN Touch for iOS</a> is great and all, but he'll always have a soft spot for the Palm Pilot version.

	<p>Drew served as President of the Iowa College Democrats, but never actually got around to graduating from Iowa State University.  Despite that, he strongly recommends that high school students go to college and stay there for years.  And if they are in computer science, they should take out some more loans.  They're going to look back in 5 years and feel pretty silly about trying to stretch 20 bucks across an entire week of drinking.

	<p>Below you will find him on all of the social networks that were judged important enough by <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> to warrant a square version of their logos.  You can also just <a href="mailto:drew@drewmiller.net">email him</a>.
