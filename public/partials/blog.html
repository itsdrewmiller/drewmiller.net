<h4>Switching to Gulp</h4>

<p><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> has been hotter than Grunt for a while now, based on the popular opinion swinging back toward code and away from configuration, and some (apparently correct) ideas that it is faster.  I decided to switch to it while I was looking for a solution to running selenium-based tests that would allow me to run them twice in a row without failing.  (I could start a server automatically with Grunt, but couldn't figure out how to shut it down effectively.)  In searching around for a solution based on running a teardown command line function with Grunt, I came across a promising repository where the owner updated the readme to say he had switched to gulp.  Since he was the closest to solving my problem, I took that as a sign that maybe I should consider switching to Gulp, also.

<p>Not long into making the switch, I found documentation explaining how I could update my protractor spec file to point to the selenium jar, which would then be started and stopped automatically by protractor.  Not sure how I never came across this when doing grunt searching, though it doesn't hurt that the <a href="https://github.com/mllrsohn/gulp-protractor">gulp-protractor readme</a> is super clear about how to do it.  So, now I am on gulp.  And other than having to start the app before running gulp locally, CI is working perfectly from my terminal and on travis.
